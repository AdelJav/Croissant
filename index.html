    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape
      of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated
      dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough
      is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession,
      then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The
      process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
      <br />
      Uncooked croissant dough can also be wrapped around any praline, almond
      paste, or chocolate before it is baked (in the last case, it becomes like
      pain au chocolat, which has a different, non-crescent, shape), or sliced
      to include sweet or savoury fillings. It may be flavored with dried fruit
      such as sultanas or raisins, or other fruits such as apples. In France and
      Spain, croissants are generally sold without filling and eaten without
      added butter, but sometimes with almond filling.
